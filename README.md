# Pharmacy_Management_System
By Niksh Hiremath

The basic idea is to make a code to order pharmacy items through a app.

It has a login page.

You have to login to order items.

If you are a worker in the pharmacy, then you will be directed to a orders page where you can see all the orders.

When you succesfully login you will be directed to a menu page.

In the menu page you have all the items in the pharmacy with there order quantity set to 0 by default.

You have to change the order quantity to the desired order.

Below to menu you will be having the following options:
1. Exit
2. Total
3. Place Order

When you click Exit, the window will close.

When you click Total, the total of all the items will be shown.

When you click Place Order, you will be directed to the payment gateway.
In the payment gateway you have to enter your card number and CVV.
If they were correct, your order will be placed. But if they were incorrect, a error will popup.

Once you have placed the order the window will be automatically closed.
